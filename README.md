## Problem Statement:
Given a list (array) of integers, determine if the smallest value in the list appears next to the largest value in the list.  If there are multiple occurrences of either the smallest or largest value, only one pair of (largest & smallest) needs to be next to each other.  If a list only contains one value then it is both the smallest and largest.  If the list is of size 1 then consider that value both the largest and smallest value

Input: The length of the list, followed by the values in the list.

Output: True or False

Example:
```
5
1 9 10 5 6
False
```
